            <p>This is my me-page for the MVC course at BTH (Bleking Tekniska HÃ¶gskola).</p>
            <p>My name is Patrik Arvius. I was born and raised in Stockholm but have family spread out across the country from the pineclad, reindeer inhabited 
            north where the sun never sets (or never rises) to the fertile plains of the south where the rapeseed fields color the world yellow and ripple like waves in the wind.</p>
            <p>I love food, with a penchant for asian cuisine aswell as motor racing (ironic seeing I don't have a drivers license), all sorts of games from pc to boardgames and swimming</p>
            <p>I'm a scifi lover at heart and I've always been fascinated with anything related to space. In terms of scifi I like it less extraordinary and more dark, gritty, 
            plausible and slightly dystopic. But I also have an interest in psychological and sociological aspects of our interpreted reality, perhaps that is why I am currently enjoying 
            Isaac Asimov's foundation book series so much.</p>
